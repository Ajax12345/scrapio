# Scrapio

This repo contains the source of several different web data extraction algorithms, originally designed to be used in conjuction with each other, but will also work as standalone miners. 

## Key Source File Directory

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
|[`tree_matcher.py`](https://github.com/Ajax12345/scrapio/blob/main/scrapio/tree_matcher.py)| An adaption of Liu and Zhai's partial tree alignment algorithm [[1](https://github.com/Ajax12345/scrapio/edit/main/README.md#references)], with several important modifications. Used for detecting structured content with few definitive HTML element attributes |
|[`tree_traversal2.py`](https://github.com/Ajax12345/scrapio/blob/main/scrapio/tree_traversal2.py)| Custom element record detection, based on tag pattern matching and similar element attribute grouping |
| [`tree_merger.py`](https://github.com/Ajax12345/scrapio/blob/main/scrapio/tree_merger.py) | Performs removal of extraneous and irrelevant HTML page content, such as headers, footers, etc. |
| [`tree_converter_handlers3.py`](https://github.com/Ajax12345/scrapio/blob/main/scrapio/tree_converter_handlers3.py) | Converts large similar record objects, ultimately generated by the preceding files, into two dimensional `JSON` objects for export later |
